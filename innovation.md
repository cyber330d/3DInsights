The innovation is the integration of interactive 3D model technology into Learning Management Systems(LMS) to enhance student comprehension and simplify the understanding of complex concepts in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education. This system enables students to interact with and visualize concepts in a three-dimensional space directly from a smartphone or laptop PC browser without any special or expensive AR/VR device, making learning more engaging and effective compared to traditional text-based and 2D methods. By improving comprehension, retention, and overall learning experiences, this LMS has potential applications in both educational institutions (enginnering) and corporate training environments.
