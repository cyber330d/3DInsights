          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-neutral-600">
            In modern educational settings, especially in STEM (Science,
            Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education, the demand for
            effective instructional methods that enhance student comprehension
            and engagement has been steadily increasing. Traditional approaches
            often struggle to convey spatial or visual concepts, leading to
            reduced comprehension and retention among learners.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 mt-4">
            Learning Management Systems (LMS) have become crucial in educational
            institutions, facilitating the management, delivery, and assessment
            of educational content. Over time, LMS platforms have evolved, but
            they still often lack the capability to effectively incorporate
            interactive and immersive learning experiences, particularly in
            disciplines that require visualization of complex spatial concepts.

            In contemporary educational environments, learners, especially in

            convey certain spatial representations, hindering comprehension and
            retention. Current LMS platforms generally lack the utilization of
